			<p><b>Brand Name</b><br>
			When it came to creating our brand name, we were quite stumped. We just did not seem to be able to think of something we could all agree upon. At first, we were leaning towards something much easier, “Team Up”. Although it was simple and already implied what the website was about, we were just not satisfied with it.<br><br> 
			
			We decided to give the name a second draft, thinking about how we could think of a name that sounds truly unique. We decided to look at Odido, which was based on the Greek word “akouein”, which means “to listen”, for inspiration. After long conversations with each other, we wanted a name that exudes confidence and fun. We looked up the translation for volleyball in Latin. There was no direct translation, but the closest thing was “Volapila,” which is of “volare”, meaning to fly, and “pila”, which translates to ball. <br><br>
				
			We took the first word, “volare”, and started switching some letters around. When we switched the O and the A, we noticed “Valore” almost sounded like “Valor”, which means great courage in the face of danger. After a bit of playing with that, we eventually changed the V to a B. We liked this since it incorporated the ball aspect of the sport. <br><br>
				
			As the last step, we decided to add an A at the end. We found that just “Balor” made it sound strange, and adding the A at the end to change it to <b>“Balora”</b>, made it sound much better and more inviting.</p>
			
			<img src="images/balora-logo-with-font.png" alt="Balora Logo" width="400px">
			<p><b>Brand Logo</b><br>Our logo went through many phases as well. Anything from incredibly simple, like having one letter, to more complex designs involving a volleyball radar. However, no matter how much we tried, we just were not able to get it right.<br><br> 
				
			After getting the feedback that our logo should be more playful, we decided to heavily lean into this. Instead of trying to salvage what was already there, we decided to scrap all of our current ideas and start completely from scratch. We tried to think of something playful, and what could be the most playful of everything, and concluded that nothing is more playful than classic cartoons.<br><br>
				
			We decided to make a cartoon character out of a volleyball and make him our logo. Not only is this logo fun, but it also plays into Gen Z and millennials' love of retro aesthetics. In a world where all companies keep simplifying and simplifying their logos, we believe our logo is a breath of fresh air, which helps it stick out among its competitors, creating a truly unique and memorable logo.</p>

			For our body font we went with "Raleway". We think this font gives a nice and prosessinonal look while still looking round and inviting, a quality that is very important to us. <br><br> 
				
			Then for our other font (which we used for all of our headers) we knew we had to go big and playful. For this we looked at our logo. It is no secret that our logo is heavily inspired by old cartoons and we really steered into that when choosing our header font. After searching for a long time, we eventually ended up with "Wicked Mouse". This font is clrearly inspired by Looney Tunes and old Disney cartoons, which fits in perfectly with our logo. Raleway was chosen as the body font for its readability in long-form content, while Wicked Mouse was used for headlines to grab attention and reinforce the brand voice, confirming  both clarity and strong visual identity.<br><br>

            <p><b>User interface patterns and structure of navigation and content</b></p>
            One of the most important aspects a website can have. For this, we went through a lot of trial and error before we got it right. <br><br>
			Firstly, let's start on the home page. When you boot up Balora, the first thing you are going to notice is the big blue bar welcoming you to the website. This section is also known as a hero section.. We went with a hero section here since we wanted our website to open with a big boom, but found that our soothing blue made it easy on the eyes as well. Below are all of the parameter options our users get when looking for a match. These parameter options consist of multiple functions. We use everything from drop-down menus, calendars, and search bars. We went with all of these options, since we found out in practice that different data was much precise and easier to use when using different kinds of menu functions.. We added these elements to these places because that is the website’s main function. The second thing our users will notice is the navigation bar at the top. On this bar, we have home, volleyball matches, about us, contact, corporate, create volleyball match, and log in. All of these options bring our users to all of the different pages of our website, and we think our users should always have access to these options. When we go down, we see two cards. One with “What is Balora?” and “How does it work?”. We decided to place these two cards here to make sure there is no confusion whatsoever about our website and its functionality.  Then, at the bottom of the page, we find the contact page. Just like the navigation bar, we find the contact bar at the bottom of every page. We find this important since we always want our users to remember they can contact us whenever they need to.<br><br> 
			
			Secondly, we will take a look at our matches page. Like the home page, the first thing that our users will see is the blue bar with all of the options. We somewhat copied the hero section from the home page for some visual consistency. The reason why we chose to reuse all the search buttons and bars here is that we want our users to be able to modify their choices whenever they want. Think of situations where a user accidentally filled in some wrong information, in this they will always have the option to correct themselves. When we scroll down, we see all of the match cards. Each card is representative of a match someone has created. Within these cards, we can find all of the appropriate information, like name, location, date, time, skill level, and a description. We put all of these here so our users can easily see what matches work for them. We went with cards in this section since we think it is a clean and efficient way to let players see all the info they need in a small and concise manner.<br><br> 
			
			Thirdly, we will take a look at our login page. We first put the user login, with registration, and forgot password below.  This is just like every other login screen is most natural for our users to use. Behind this bar, we can see a picture of people playing volleyball with a setting sun in the background. We found the people playing to be very welcoming to new users. That, mixed with the warm colors of the setting sun, really gives the login screen an amazing welcome feeling, which we were aiming for.<br><br> 
			
			Fourthly, let’s take a look at our About Us page. Here we are greeted by a nice picture of a volleyball field around us. We found this to be very aesthetically pleasing, while still keeping in line with what our website is about. When we scroll down, we can find our brand vision. We put this at the top of our About Us page since we find that one of the most important aspects of this page. When our users see this part, they immediately know what Balora is all about. On the left side of this card, we can see a video playing. What better way to convey a vision than to show people? We had one of our talented members edit a nice video that accompanies the text explaining our brand vision flawlessly. Below that are our values. These are neatly organized in drop-down accordions. We found that just putting cards with our information here was messy, and the page ended up feeling cluttered because of it. That is why we decided to store them away in smaller accordions, so that our users can read them once they click on them.  Below our values, our users can find our brand persona. We think our user base would greatly appreciate seeing what we are based on them, and know people can truly find themselves in our created brand persona. Our brand persona is below the other two information blocks since we thought it was more important for our users to learn about us before they can see what we think our general audience is. And lastly, we can see our style guide. We put this at the bottom of the page since we saw this as a nice bonus for die-hard Balora fans. It is truly there for people who love our brand and like to see where all of our styling decisions come from, but since not everyone will be such a die-hard fan, we decided to place this element at the bottom. At first, we had this vision board posted at the bottom in full, but this made the web page simply way too large. After trying out multiple solutions, we decided on using a carousel. This allowed us to split the vision board into three equally large pieces, meaning we could shorten it to two-thirds. This makes the size of the page much more digestible.<br><br>
			
			Lastly, there is the contact page. Even though we have a contact bar at the bottom of every page, we wanted to give our users the option to contact us directly from the website. We know that taking extra steps that lead away from our website can often be cumbersome for our users, so we wanted to give everyone the option to contact us from the website directly.

  <!--Testing report-->			  
  <h2 id="production-3" class="mt-2"><b>Testing Report</b></h2>
	  <section>
		<p>Our primary objective was to find how our users like our current interface and how we can improve it, so we can make an easy and simple experience for our target audience.</p>
	  </section>

	  <p><b>What should our users be able to do during the testing protocol?</b></p>
	  <section>

		  <li>Learn the use of Balora in a matter of seconds.</li>
		  <li>Easily navigate the website (locate and join volleyball matches).</li>
		  <li>Find out the playful and approachable brand tone we strive for.</li>
		</ul>
	  </section>

	  <p><br><b>Participations</b></p>
	  <section>
		<p>We tested the protocol on five participants from our target audience. To be eligible, participants had to be international students or young adults (aged 18 to 30) living in the Netherlands and interested in volleyball.</p>
	  </section>

	  <p><b>Setting</b></p>
	  <section>
		<ul>
		  <li>Depending on the participant's availability, the test was administered in-person on campus in a closed room. </li>

		</ul>
	  </section>

	  <p><br><b>Protocol</b></p>
	  <section>
		<p>After a brief introduction, participants will be informed that they are free to speak out loud and that we are testing the website, not them. Four important activities (such as "Find a volleyball game near you" and "Sign up as a new player") will be required of them. <br>
		We'll encourage participants to share their thoughts while they browse the website using a "think aloud" technique. Key observations will be gathered for usability insights, and sessions will be audio-recorded.<br>
		We'll do a brief feedback interview regarding their experience, preferences, and overall impressions following the tasks.</p>
	  </section>

	  <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
	  <section>
		<p>Thank you for participating in this user test for Balora, a platform that helps people find and join local volleyball games. We're testing the website to see how clear and user-friendly it is. There are no right or wrong answers here.</p>
		<p>As you go through the tasks, please say your thoughts out loud—anything you’re thinking, feeling, or wondering. This helps us understand how users experience the website.</p>
		<p>At the end, we’ll ask you a few short questions about your experience and any feedback you have. This is going to take around 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
	  </section>

		  <li>What would you improve or change about the website?</li>
		</ul>
	  </section>

	  <h3><br>Findings</h3>
	  <section>
		<p>After creating our website and getting it running, we tested our website on multiple users to get insight into how our app works and how people like it. The findings were surprising and very insightful.</p>

		<p>The first task we had our users do was to find out what Balora is. This went very well. All of the users were able to identify that Balora is a website that helps people find and create volleyball matches using key visuals and clear options.</p>

		<p><b>Main tasks:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Finding a match</li>
		  <li>Joining a match</li>
		  <li>Creating a match</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br>While no one failed these tasks, there were some errors. For example, one user misunderstood the term "match" as a romantic match, similar to Tinder. This shows a need for clearer terminology. <br>Another user noticed inconsistency in the search bar design between the home page and the matches screen. They suggested keeping them consistent. One issue with the prototype was the login page, which did not work. <br>Users found this confusing, but this is expected with prototypes. Another comment was about redundancy: there are two buttons for creating a match — one in the matches dropdown and one in the top right corner. A user found this unnecessary. <br> When users tried to find out how Balora works, they were able to get to the About Us page, but some were confused due to too much text on the homepage. A suggestion was made to either reduce the text or move it to a separate page.</p>However, as previously stated, all tasks were completed without interference from any of the Balora staff. The testers remarked that the design of the website was very straightforward for the most part and very user-friendly, with button placements being where they should be and navigation feeling very natural. They noted they really liked the cartoony aesthetic and thought the colour palette complemented it very well. This combination of colour palette and design gave a very welcoming feeling to the users, which they very much appreciated. One participant noted she liked the gender selection option since it allowed her to create an environment in which she felt safer by being able to select a female-only team.<br> <br>
	  </section>

	  <p><b>Overall Impressions</b></p>
	  <section>
		<p><b>Positives</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Clear and straightforward functionality.</li>
		  <li>Tasks were completed without help.</li>
		  <li>Inviting color scheme and logical placements.</li>
		  <li>Strong character in design.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Negatives</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Terminology around "match" was confusing.</li>
		  <li>Inconsistencies between pages (e.g., search bars).</li>
		  <li>Visual aspects (color choices and overuse of cards) could be improved.</li>
		  <li>Too much text in some areas, which could be intimidating.</li>
		</ul>
	  </section>

	  <h3><br>Improvements</h3>
	  <section>
		<p>Based on the testing findings, the following improvements have been made.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Instead of ‘matches’, the terminology used throughout the website has been adjusted to ‘volleyball matches’ to prevent any confusion with romantic matches. </li>
		  <li>We made all the search bars fully consistent.</li>
		  <li>The signature colours of Balora have been implemented in more areas throughout the website. The primary buttons are in the main blue colour that represents our brand and the secondary buttons are coloured red. We added coloured borders around cards with the secondary signature colours (red and yellow) and elements like cartoon hands for swiping and folding functions. </li>
		  <li>Regarding the overuse of cards in the volleyball matches page, we have lowered the number of cards a bit; this way, we create more space, making it easier to navigate the website.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><br>Two points of feedback drawn from the findings have not been adjusted. The first one stated that the amount of text was too much on the homepage. We reflected on this, but concluded that the text was necessary and instead partially solved it by highlighting the key take-aways in bold to make it easier to read without cutting out on any crucial information. Secondly, one participant commented that a second button to create a match was redundant. However, we consciously chose to keep two buttons instead of one to make the user interface more accessible to different kinds of thought processes when searching for the button.<br><br> 
		Besides the suggestions of the participants, we came up with three points of improvement by reflecting on the website. 
		The first one would be improving the login page. A pop-up message could be added, stating that the message was successfully sent.<br><br>
		Secondly, it would add to the UX if a page where the users can create a new volleyball match, with accessible user interface patterns like dropdown menus, input boxes, and buttons to customise the elements that make up a match (as displayed on the volleyball matches page) were created.<br><br>
		Lastly, a function where users get added to the website’s group chat once they sign up for a volleyball match could add to the feeling of safety. In the chat, team members of the relevant volleyball match would be able to get to know each other a bit better before meeting each other in real life. This aspect could make the users feel more grounded and safe in their decision to spontaneously join a volleyball match.  
		</p>
	  </section>
			  
	  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
	  <section>
		<p>The initial prototype of Balora was received surprisingly well. Most things functioned as expected, and the layout made sense to users. There is still room for improvement, but fortunately most of the improvement points have been identified and are ready to be applied. We view these test results and reflections as a positive step forward in improving and growing our platform.</p>

  <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
    <h3 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Communication and Media Plan and Marketing Campaign</h3>

	  <p><b>Campaign Overview</b></p>
	  <p>In the Netherlands, many international students struggle to find a local sport community, especially for team sports like volleyball. Weekly matches at traditional student clubs can be hard to commit to, and language barriers often make things even more challenging.</p>
	  <p>Even though volleyball is a popular, non-contact and accessible sport that brings people together, finding a team to play with without the complications of commitment can feel out of reach when you're far from home or don't know where to start.</p>
	  <p><b><em>That's where Balora comes in.</em></b> Balora is the helping hand, offering international students a platform where they can find their local volleyball community. They get the opportunity to create and join spontaneous matches in their area, without the stress of a traditional club and the language pressure. Balora serves as an easy gateway to connect and play volleyball <em>your way</em>, anytime, anywhere.</p>

	  <p><b>Why Balora?</b></p>
	  <p>Balora is a new platform that makes playing volleyball spontaneous, accessible, and social. Your skill level doesn’t matter—Balora connects international students in your area who are eager to play volleyball. Whether you want to find a team, join matches, or create your own spontaneous game, Balora helps make it happen.</p>

	  <p><b>The Campaign’s Purpose</b></p>
	  <p>This campaign aims to build brand awareness and create interest among our target audience: primarily international students in the Netherlands who love volleyball but struggle to find people to play with. Instead of promoting Balora as a formal product/service, the campaign will use a mix of humor, relatable scenarios, and a friendly tone to show that Balora is here to help and always within reach.</p>

	  <p><b>Emotional Core</b></p>
	  <p>This campaign is more than just promoting our brand. It’s about giving our target audience a sense of belonging. Starting a new life in a different country can already be overwhelming, but sometimes, all it takes to feel at home is a shared hobby. That is why Balora offers a way to turn strangers into teammates and teammates into friends. Balora is a reminder that even far from home, there is a place for you. <b>Volleyball, your way – Anytime, anywhere.</b></p>

  <h3>Post 1: Poster Image (Instagram)</h3>
	  <p><b>What you see:</b> An eye-catching picture of people playing volleyball on a beach as the sun goes down. They're shown as silhouettes, which makes it feel peaceful and like a nice, nostalgic summer evening. The words at the top say, "Dreaming of a volleyball match, but no one to play with?" and at the bottom it says, Balora has your back, find local teams and players to get in the game.</p>
	  <p><b>Caption:</b> "No volleyball team? No problem! 🏐 Balora is coming soon to help you find players. Stay tuned!"#Balora #FindYourTeam #volleyballtime #volleyball #comingsoon #volleyballcommunity</p>
	  <p><b>Vibe:</b> Relaxed and fun, like a chill summer day at the beach. It's meant to make students and young people who like volleyball feel like Balora understands their desires.</p>

  <h3><br>Post 2: Audio-Visual (TikTok/Instagram Reels)</h3>
	  <p><b>What you see:</b> A girl serves a volleyball, almost hitting a student sitting nearby in a casual outdoor setting (grass, houses in the back, sunny day). Right before the ball almost hits, the student looks at the camera and says, "You were probably waiting for that ball to hit me right? Well I am waiting for you to follow Balora, right now!" Then (surprise) the ball hits him anyway, and he makes a face and falls over. For this post, we did not make a difference between the two posts on Instagram and Tiktok.</p>
	  <p><b>Caption:</b> "Join Balora to find volleyball teams! ⚡ Let's play!" #Balora #TeamUp #Volleyball #fyp</p>
	  <p><b>Vibe:</b> Funny, surprising, viral potential.  A twist to a viral trend, keeping it funny and unexpected, trying to grab attention and make people laugh while telling them to join Balora.</p>

  <h3>Post 3: Audio-Visual (TikTok/Instagram Reels)</h3>
	  <p><b>What you see:</b> The video starts with someone struggling to plug something into a smartboard. They give up because it's not working. They drop the cable and walk towards the camera. Behind them, you can spot a laptop with the Balora logo. The person then talks to the camera, saying people often ask him how to connect a laptop to a big screen. He jokes that his name isn't even Larry! But, he knows how to find volleyball players of all levels easily – the answer is Balora. Then, just like in the other video, he gets hit by a volleyball, and the video ends. On Tiktok the post has subtitles, while on Instagram it does not.</p>
	  <p><b>Caption:</b>Learning how to work with technology is super fun. But do you know what’s even more fun? Playing volleyball of course! If you ache for that spontaneous volleyball match, but don’t know enough available people to play with - then start your volleyball journey now with Balora! Find teammates anytime, anywhere!

	  <p><b>Call to Action:</b>The caption encourages viewers to "start your volleyball journey now with Balora!" and highlights the "Find teammates anytime, anywhere!" aspect, which is a key part of Balora's message. </p>
			
  <h3>Post 4: Audio-Visual (TikTok/Instagram Reels)</h3>
	  <p><b>What you see:</b> The video is a quick and energetic compilation of short video clips with a volleyball. You see different people playing volleyball. The video starts with one girl holding a volleyball and soon switches to the same girl with a whole volleyball team. A text appears ‘POV: You just found your dream volleyball team thanks to Balora. They all cheer and the ball hit the boy that gets hits at every video. After that there is a cut to a call to action where you can see the brand’s logo. For this post, we did not create a difference in audio-visual features on Instagram and Tiktok.</p>
	  <p><b>Audio:</b>The music playing in the background is upbeat and exciting, which adds to the fast-paced and fun feeling of the video.</p>
	  <p><b>End screen/Call to Action:</b>At the very end of the Reel, the Balora logo appears clearly, along with text that says "you don’t have to look further for a volleyball team, join the balora community and let’s join!</p>

	  <p><b>Analysis</b> A TikTok post uploaded on April 7, 2025 at 21:00. The post collected a total of 817video views.</p>	
	  <p><b>Audience reach and engagement:</b>The post demonstrated a strong ability to reach new users as it was the first Audio-visual post on Instagram and the first post on Tiktok, with 91% of viewers being new to the content. Returning viewers constituted a smaller segment, but more than previously at 9%. Engagement metrics indicate positive reception. The post received 27 likes, 2 comments, 3 share. </p>
	  <p><b>Audience demographics:</b>Demographic analysis reveals that the primary audience segment by gender was female, accounting for 79% of viewers and male viewers comprised 21%. In terms of age distribution, the largest viewership segment fell within the 18-24 year old range at 60%. Subsequent age groups included 25-34 (26%), 35-44 (6%), 45-54 (6%), and 55+ (2%).</p>

	  <p><b> Retention metrics:</b>The average watch time for the video was 3.5 seconds. Notably, 8.73% of viewers watched the video in its entirety.</p>
	  <p><b> Ecperience analysis:</b>Based on the number of likes, comments, and shares, we can conclude that overall, the viewers had a positive emotional connection to our post. However, the low average watch time suggests that future content should focus on grabbing attention more effectively within the first few seconds to improve viewer retention and overall impact.</p>
	  <p>The following two posts are posts that we aired in differnt orders across the two platforms</p>

   <h3>Post 5: Audio-Visual (TikTok/Instagram Reels)</h3>		
	  <p><b>What you see:</b> Two girls find a volleyball and are bummed they don't have enough people to play with. Suddenly, the scene changes to show them playing with a whole group of players. The video finishes with the Balora logo and a call to action.</p>
	  <p><b>Audio:</b>The music starts a little sad when the girls realize they need more players, then switches to an upbeat and exciting track when the group is playing. During the upbeat part, a voice says, "Balora helps you find volleyball players nearby, connecting you with a team, Anytime, Anywhere for a fun, spontaneous volleyball match."</p>
	  <p><b>End screen/Call to Action:</b>The Balora logo appears at the end with the text: "Looking for your next volleyball match? Join the Balora community and let's play!" </p>

	  <p><b>Caption:</b> "Want to play volleyball but need teammates? Look no further! Finding volleyball players has never been easier. Hit the follow button and join our community! #balora #fyp #volleyball #TeamUp #findyourteam #foryou #trending #volleyballplayer". </p>
	  <p><b>Vibe:</b>The video demonstrates a quick shift from being a little sad about not having enough players to being happy and energetic while playing with a team, all thanks to Balora.</p>
			  
   <h3>Post 6: Audio-Visual (TikTok/Instagram Reels)</h3>
	  <p><b>What you see:</b>The video starts with one person throwing a volleyball back and forth over the camera as if playing with someone on the other side. Each time the ball comes back, another player joins on each side. It goes from 1 vs 1, to 2 vs 2, and keeps growing until there are 4 players on each team. The last person to receive the ball is the same boy who gets hit in the other funny video, and he falls down. The video ends with the Balora logo and the text: "Looking for your next volleyball match? Join the Balora community and let's play!"</p>
	  <p><b>Audio:</b>The music is upbeat and exciting throughout the whole video, just like in the other videos.</p>
	  <p><b>End screen/Call to Action:</b>The Balora logo appears at the end with the text: "Looking for your next volleyball match? Join the Balora community and let's play!"</p>
	  <p><b>Caption:</b> "Go from playing alone to a full team with Balora, anytime and anywhere! #Volleyball #balora #volleyballteam #team #players"</p>
	  <p><b>Vibe:</b> Energetic and shows how easily you can go from having no team to a full team using Balora.</p>

	  <p><b> Retention metrics</b>The average watch time for the whole video was 2 hours and 58 minutes with an average rate view of 6 sec.</p>
	  <p><b> Engagement Analyis:</b> The data indicates that this Audio-visual reel was effective in reaching new viewers, especially on Instagram, since this video didn’t do as well on TikTok. Overall, the post helped Balora’s visibility and showed potential to grow a community on Instagram, but future videos primarily TikTok posts should focus on grabbing the attention earlier on in the video to improve the performance. </p>
	  <h3>Instagram story post:</h3>
	  <p>To end our campaign, we decided to make a poll on the instagram story. Even though we don’t have the fully developed website, we wanted to make sure our target audience understood the videos and is ready for when it is launched. </p>

		<p><b> Story 1:</b>This image was created to showcase and spark curiosity; the person looks like he wants to play but has no one to play with. We wanted to visually create a common feeling among international students who struggle to find teammates. 
	    The poll says “Would you check Balora’s website to find teammates”. With 3 options to choose from. 
			1: 100%  
			2. Maybe, I need more info 
			3. No  

	    The most chosen answer is option 1, which indicates that our followers are curious and ready to visit Balora’s website. </p>

		<p><b> Story 2:</b>The purpose of the second poll was to visibly hide the individual's face in order to mimic the experience of joining a match on the website, where players are strangers when playing a match. The goal of this was to simulate the platform's real-world use and see if they would take the step to actually use Balora. Again, three possible answers were provided to viewers, with the question, “Would you use Balora to join a volleyball match.” 

		YES, I would use it often!!, which has 38% of the votes  

		Yes, for funsies, which has 52% of the votes. 

		No, I’m not interested with has 10% of votes.
		In conclusion, the survey indicates that 90% of participants are interested in using Balora, confirming that our audience finds the concept appealing. </p>

		<p><b> Story 3:</b> The poll question, "Are you excited for the launch of Balora?" was illustrated by a picture that created a tone of confidence, intrigue, and seriousness. This creative decision tried to determine whether our target audience felt a sense of excitement within the Balora community. The response choices were playfully created in order to maintain the campaign's particularly humorous tone: 

		1. YOU BET I AM, which has 41% votes 

		2. YESYESYESYES, which has 47 votes 

		3. Yes. Which has 12% votes </p>
			
  <h3 id="marketing-2" class="mt-2">Learning points:</h3>
			  
		<p>
		  The campaign highlighted the effectiveness of using humor and relatable scenarios to capture the attention of our target audience (international students). With the objective of creating funny and relatable situations (hitting someone with a volleyball, tech struggles), we learned that people do engage with content that mirrors their own experiences and makes them laugh. This was especially important for initially reaching a (new) audience on platforms like TikTok, as it helped break the ice and make Balora feel friendly and approachable.
		</p>

		<p><b>What did you learn during the duration of the project regarding the campaign?</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>We learned that short, attention-grabbing video content performs well on TikTok for initial reach. Instagram and TikTok audiences might respond differently to the same content (Post 6 performed better on Instagram).</li>
		  <li>Posting content at 12pm performs better than at 21:00, despite the fact that we found a source that said 21:00 is the best time to post.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><b>What worked:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Humorous and relatable short videos (Posts 1 and 5) were effective in achieving high initial views, especially on Instagram.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><b>What didn't work well:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The average watch time on TikTok (around 3.5–4.7 seconds for 10–15 second videos) suggests viewers weren't always watching the full video, indicating a potential drop-off in engagement.</li>
		  <li>The initial image post on Instagram (Post 1) likely didn't grab attention as effectively as the video content.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><b>What went as expected:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The need for a platform like Balora among international students was confirmed by the engagement on both platforms.</li>
		  <li>TikTok proved to be a strong platform for initial reach with short videos, suggesting the hook might need to be stronger or the content more consistently engaging.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><b>What didn't go as expected:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The average watch time on TikTok was lower than anticipated for short videos, suggesting the hook might need to be stronger or the content more consistently engaging.</li>
		  <li>The difference in performance between Instagram and TikTok for the same video content.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><b>What would you do differently?</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Focus even more on the first few seconds of TikTok videos to maximize retention and full view rates.</li>
		  <li>Tailor content more specifically to each platform (create unique content for Instagram Reels vs. TikTok).</li>
		  <li>Analyze the reasons behind the better performance of certain posts (specific humor or visuals used) and replicate those elements.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><b>Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned.</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>This campaign provided valuable insights into reaching a specific audience (international students seeking sports communities) using social media.</li>
		  <li>We learned that humor and relatability are strong tools for initial engagement, particularly on platforms like TikTok.</li>
		  <li>Understanding platform-specific content preferences and optimizing for retention are crucial for maximizing impact.</li>
		</ul>
			  

  <h3 id="marketing-3" class="mt-2"><br>Future Planning</h3>
			  
		<p><b>Reflection on what's Been Done:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>We tried to make funny and relatable videos for international students who want to play volleyball.</li>
		  <li>We learned that short, funny videos on TikTok can get a lot of people to watch at first.</li>
		  <li>Showing situations they might understand (like tech problems) can grab their attention.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Future recommendations if the project continued:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Make even funnier and shorter TikToks right away: In the first few seconds, something super surprising or silly to make people stop scrolling and watch the whole thing. Maybe even try some trending sounds or challenges that fit our volleyball theme!</li>
		  <li>Make special videos just for Instagram Reels: Maybe show more volleyball tricks or team highlights that look really good visually, since Instagram is more about the visuals, pictures, and videos.</li>
		  <li>Ask more questions in the videos and captions: "Have you ever almost hit someone with a volleyball?" to get people to comment and share their own stories. This makes it feel like a conversation!</li>
		  <li>Try to get people to visit the Balora website directly from TikTok and Instagram: Since the website would be online, we would put a link in our bio and tell people in the videos to "check the link in bio to find teams near you!" This could help measure objectives like how many people click on a link.</li>
		  <li>Watch the numbers more closely: See which videos get the most likes, comments, and shares, and then make more videos like those. Also, see when people stop watching our videos and try to make those parts more interesting.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Process of what we would do differently:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Spend more time planning the very beginning of each video: The first few seconds are super important to keep people watching, especially on TikTok. We'd brainstorm lots of different ways to grab attention right away with something funny or exciting.</li>
		  <li>Make videos a little bit shorter and punchier for TikTok: Since people don't watch for very long on average, we'd try to get our message across really quickly and keep it super entertaining.</li>
		  <li>Create different kinds of content for TikTok and Instagram from the start: Instead of just posting the same video on both, we'd think about what works best on each platform. TikTok for short, funny stuff, and Instagram for maybe more visually cool or community-focused content.</li>
		  <li>Try to connect with other student groups or volleyball clubs online: Maybe we could team up with them to share our videos and reach even more people who are interested in volleyball.</li>
		  <li>Set up a way to track how many people actually join Balora after seeing our videos: This would help us see if our videos are really working to get people to use the platform!</li>
		</ul>

   <h3 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h3>
		  
		<p><b>Problem (based on the problem interviews)</b><br><br>
			• International students can't easily find local volleyball games.<br>
			• Most volleyball clubs require long-term commitment, high skill, or Dutch fluency.<br>
			• There's no central, casual platform to join or host spontaneous games in nearby areas.</p>

		<p><b>Solution (based on the problem and solution interviews)</b><br><br>
		• Filter and find volleyball games by location and skill level.<br>
		• Join or create fun, spontaneous matches with one click.<br>
		• Community-driven, connect with other players in a team setting.</p>

		<b>Primary:</b> International students (ages 18–25) living/studying in the Netherlands, struggling with language barriers or organizations when joining sports in a foreign country.<br><br>
		<b>Secondary:</b> Dutch students and casual volleyball lovers who want to play more often but lack a team.<br><br>
		<b>Ideal Customer Characteristics:</b><br>
		• Interested in social activities and meeting new people<br>

		• Looking for flexible and non-committal ways to play volleyball</p>

		<h3 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h3>

		<p><b>Problem Interviews</b><br><br>
		In our problem interviews with international students in the Netherlands, we explored the specific challenges they encounter when trying to participate in local volleyball games. We identified important challenges that helped shape our concept and focus on elements of our brand, such as accessibility, connection and community building. A commonly mentioned frustration was the difficulty in finding casual, local games that didn't require a long-term commitment or a high skill level. Many felt excluded from existing volleyball clubs due to these factors, as well as the potential language barrier. A problem that was mentioned often in the interviews was the lack of central platforms where they could easily discover and join spontaneous games in their area.</p>

		<p>Participants expressed a desire for a way to connect with other players without the pressure of tryouts or weekly obligations. This lack of a simple solution often led to feelings of isolation and missed opportunities for social interaction and physical activity. The need for a platform that specifically caters to non-Dutch speakers was also highlighted, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity. These observations highlighted the need for an easy-to-use platform that connects the local volleyball scene with international students looking for informal play. Based on these findings, we improved our value proposition by shifting our focus from building a volleyball platform to creating a community-centered, low-barrier platform tailored to international students. We adjusted our plan to emphasize features that give spontaneous play and English focused. </p>

		<p><b>Solution Interviews</b><br><br>
		Throughout our solution interviews, we presented international students with the concept of Balora, our website platform, and gathered valuable feedback to further refine our business model and website features. Many interviewees were hesitant to join structured clubs but were enthusiastic about the idea of one-click access to casual games. The ability to filter games by both location and skill level was seen as crucial for finding relevant and enjoyable matches. The community-driven aspect of Balora, making connections between players in a team setting, resonated  with the desire for social interaction and meeting new people. Trust is a crucial element; consumers said that if there were clearer indicators of skill level and a friendly, non-competitive environment, they would be more likely to participate in games and use the platform. Several interviewees appreciated the focus on international students and the promise of a platform that exceeds language barriers. Features like clear game descriptions, easy RSVP options, and potentially even player ratings were suggested to enhance trust and allow smooth game organization. Practical considerations, such as mobile accessibility and clear location information, were also highlighted. Overall, the interviews confirmed a strong interest in an accessible and inclusive platform like Balora that simplifies the process of finding and joining casual volleyball games, giving a sense of community among international students.</p>
