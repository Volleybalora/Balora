			<p><b>Brand Name</b><br> We decided to give the name a second draft, thinking about how we could think of a name that sounds truly unique. We decided to look at Odido, which was based on the Greek word “akouein”, which means “to listen”, for inspiration. After long conversations with each other, we wanted a name that exudes confidence and fun. We looked up the translation for volleyball in Latin. There was no direct translation, but the closest thing was “Volapila,” which is of “volare”, meaning to fly, and “pila”, which translates to ball. <br><br>We took the first word, “volare”, and started switching some letters around. When we switched the O and the A, we noticed “Valore” almost sounded like “Valor”, which means great courage in the face of danger. After a bit of playing with that, we eventually changed the V to a B. We liked this since it incorporated the ball aspect of the sport. <br><br>As the last step, we decided to add an A at the end. We found that just “Balor” made it sound strange, and adding the A at the end to change it to <b>“Balora”</b>, made it sound much better and more inviting.</p>
			<img src="images/balora-logo-with-font.png" alt="Balora Logo" width="400px">
			<p><b>Brand Logo</b><br>Our logo went through many phases as well. Anything from incredibly simple, like having one letter, to more complex designs involving a volleyball radar. However, no matter how much we tried, we just were not able to get it right.<br><br> After getting the feedback that our logo should be more playful, we decided to heavily lean into this. Instead of trying to salvage what was already there, we decided to scrap all of our current ideas and start completely from scratch. We tried to think of something playful, and what could be the most playful of everything, and concluded that nothing is more playful than classic cartoons. <br><br>We decided to make a cartoon character out of a volleyball and make him our logo. Not only is this logo fun, but it also plays into Gen Z and millennials' love of retro aesthetics. In a world where all companies keep simplifying and simplifying their logos, we believe our logo is a breath of fresh air, which helps it stick out among its competitors, creating a truly unique and memorable logo.</p>

                  <em>The blue colour is inspired by the original volleyball colours, but is tailored to our brand personality. We are a brand with a welcoming, energetic and positive feel, which shows in our marketing campaign. Thus, we chose this specific warmer shade of blue, because it accurately fits those descriptions while maintaining the feelings of energy, youthfulness and sports that come with volleyball.</em>

                  <em>The beige colour is a slight twist on the traditional colours of a volleyball, so we are keeping the connection, but tailoring it to our brand personality and values. For instance, beige more strongly represents the warmth, accessibility, connection and inclusivity our brand stands for.

            <li><strong>Font choices:<br></strong> 
				For our body font we went with "Raleway". We think this font gives a nice and prosessinonal look while still looking round and inviting, a quality that is very important to us. <br><br> Then for our other font (which we used for all of our headers) we knew we had to go big and playful. For this we looked at our logo. It is no secret that our logo is heavily inspired by old cartoons and we really steered into that when choosing our header font. After searching for a long time, we eventually ended up with "Wicked Mouse". This font is clrearly inspired by Looney Tunes and old Disney cartoons, which fits in perfectly with our logo.<br><br></li>
            <li><b>User interface patterns and structure of navigation and content</b></li>
            One of the most important aspects a website can have. For this, we went through a lot of trial and error before we got it right. <br><br>Firstly, let's start on the home page. When you boot up Balora, the first thing you are going to notice is the big blue bar welcoming you to the website. This section is also known as a hero section.. We went with a hero section here since we wanted our website to open with a big boom, but found that our soothing blue made it easy on the eyes as well. Below are all of the parameter options our users get when looking for a match. These parameter options consist of multiple functions. We use everything from drop-down menus, calendars, and search bars. We went with all of these options, since we found out in practice that different data was much precise and easier to use when using different kinds of menu functions.. We added these elements to these places because that is the website’s main function. The second thing our users will notice is the navigation bar at the top. On this bar, we have home, volleyball matches, about us, contact, corporate, create volleyball match, and log in. All of these options bring our users to all of the different pages of our website, and we think our users should always have access to these options. When we go down, we see two cards. One with “What is Balora?” and “How does it work?”. We decided to place these two cards here to make sure there is no confusion whatsoever about our website and its functionality.  Then, at the bottom of the page, we find the contact page. Just like the navigation bar, we find the contact bar at the bottom of every page. We find this important since we always want our users to remember they can contact us whenever they need to.<br><br> Secondly, we will take a look at our matches page. Like the home page, the first thing that our users will see is the blue bar with all of the options. We somewhat copied the hero section from the home page for some visual consistency. The reason why we chose to reuse all the search buttons and bars here is that we want our users to be able to modify their choices whenever they want. Think of situations where a user accidentally filled in some wrong information, in this they will always have the option to correct themselves. When we scroll down, we see all of the match cards. Each card is representative of a match someone has created. Within these cards, we can find all of the appropriate information, like name, location, date, time, skill level, and a description. We put all of these here so our users can easily see what matches work for them. We went with cards in this section since we think it is a clean and efficient way to let players see all the info they need in a small and concise manner.<br><br> Thirdly, we will take a look at our login page. We first put the user login, with registration, and forgot password below.  This is just like every other login screen is most natural for our users to use. Behind this bar, we can see a picture of people playing volleyball with a setting sun in the background. We found the people playing to be very welcoming to new users. That, mixed with the warm colors of the setting sun, really gives the login screen an amazing welcome feeling, which we were aiming for.<br><br> Fourthly, let’s take a look at our About Us page. Here we are greeted by a nice picture of a volleyball field around us. We found this to be very aesthetically pleasing, while still keeping in line with what our website is about. When we scroll down, we can find our brand vision. We put this at the top of our About Us page since we find that one of the most important aspects of this page. When our users see this part, they immediately know what Balora is all about. On the left side of this card, we can see a video playing. What better way to convey a vision than to show people? We had one of our talented members edit a nice video that accompanies the text explaining our brand vision flawlessly. Below that are our values. These are neatly organized in drop-down accordions. We found that just putting cards with our information here was messy, and the page ended up feeling cluttered because of it. That is why we decided to store them away in smaller accordions, so that our users can read them once they click on them.  Below our values, our users can find our brand persona. We think our user base would greatly appreciate seeing what we are based on them, and know people can truly find themselves in our created brand persona. Our brand persona is below the other two information blocks since we thought it was more important for our users to learn about us before they can see what we think our general audience is. And lastly, we can see our style guide. We put this at the bottom of the page since we saw this as a nice bonus for die-hard Balora fans. It is truly there for people who love our brand and like to see where all of our styling decisions come from, but since not everyone will be such a die-hard fan, we decided to place this element at the bottom. At first, we had this vision board posted at the bottom in full, but this made the web page simply way too large. After trying out multiple solutions, we decided on using a carousel. This allowed us to split the vision board into three equally large pieces, meaning we could shorten it to two-thirds. This makes the size of the page much more digestible.<br><br>
Lastly, there is the contact page. Even though we have a contact bar at the bottom of every page, we wanted to give our users the option to contact us directly from the website. We know that taking extra steps that lead away from our website can often be cumbersome for our users, so we wanted to give everyone the option to contact us from the website directly.

  <p><b>Findings</b></p>
  <section>
    <p>After creating our website and getting it running, we tested our website on multiple users to get insight into how our app works and how people like it. The findings were surprising and very insightful.</p>

    <p>The first task we had our users do was to find out what Balora is. This went very well. All of the users were able to identify that Balora is a website that helps people find and create volleyball matches using key visuals and clear options.</p>

    <p><strong>Main tasks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finding a match</li>
      <li>Joining a match</li>
      <li>Creating a match</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While no one failed these tasks, there were some errors. For example, one user misunderstood the term "match" as a romantic match, similar to Tinder. This shows a need for clearer terminology. <br>Another user noticed inconsistency in the search bar design between the home page and the matches screen. They suggested keeping them consistent. One issue with the prototype was the login page, which did not work. <br>Users found this confusing, but this is expected with prototypes. Another comment was about redundancy: there are two buttons for creating a match — one in the matches dropdown and one in the top right corner. A user found this unnecessary. <br> When users tried to find out how Balora works, they were able to get to the About Us page, but some were confused due to too much text on the homepage. A suggestion was made to either reduce the text or move it to a separate page.</p>
  </section>

  <p><b>Overall Impressions</b></p>
  <section>
    <p><b>Positives</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear and straightforward functionality.</li>
      <li>Tasks were completed without help.</li>
      <li>Inviting color scheme and logical placements.</li>
      <li>Strong character in design.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Negatives</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Terminology around "match" was confusing.</li>
      <li>Inconsistencies between pages (e.g., search bars).</li>
      <li>Visual aspects (color choices and overuse of cards) could be improved.</li>
      <li>Too much text in some areas, which could be intimidating.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <section>
    <p>The initial prototype of Balora was received surprisingly well. Most things functioned as expected, and the layout made sense to users.</p>
    <p>There is still room for improvement, especially in design consistency, button placement, and simplifying text-heavy sections.</p>
    <p>We view these test results as a positive step forward in improving and growing our platform.</p>

  <h1>Communication and Media Plan and Marketing Campaign</h1>

  <h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
  <p>In the Netherlands, many international students struggle to find a local sport community, especially for team sports like volleyball. Weekly matches at traditional student clubs can be hard to commit to, and language barriers often make things even more challenging.</p>
  <p>Even though volleyball is a popular, non-contact and accessible sport that brings people together, finding a team to play with without the complications of commitment can feel out of reach when you're far from home or don't know where to start.</p>
  <p><strong>That's where Balora comes in.</strong> Balora is the helping hand, offering international students a platform where they can find their local volleyball community. They get the opportunity to create and join spontaneous matches in their area, without the stress of a traditional club and the language pressure. Balora serves as an easy gateway to connect and play volleyball <em>your way</em>, anytime, anywhere.</p>

  <h2>Why Balora?</h2>
  <p>Balora is a new platform that makes playing volleyball spontaneous, accessible, and social. Your skill level doesn’t matter—Balora connects international students in your area who are eager to play volleyball.

  <h2>The Campaign’s Purpose</h2>
  <p>This campaign aims to build brand awareness and create interest among our target audience: primarily international students in the Netherlands who love volleyball but struggle to find people to play with.

  <h2>Emotional Core</h2>
  <p>This campaign is more than just promoting our brand. It’s about giving our target audience a sense of belonging. Starting a new life in a different country can already be overwhelming, but sometimes, all it takes to feel at home is a shared hobby.
